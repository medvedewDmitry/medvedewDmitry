ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Dmitry and I am a frontend developer. I like to learn new things and reach different heights. So one day I decided to try myself in IT.

I'm interested in creating user interfaces that people will use âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨

I started with HTML and CSS layout, but then I started to delve into different ways of creating interfaces, which led me to the React framework âš›

Here you can see my small pet projects and projects that I managed to coordinate for publication.

I am open to communication and will be glad to exchange experiences with those who are also interested in this ðŸ˜‰.
